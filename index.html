          Hi, I'm Dare Ogundipe. I’m a web developer with experience building apps with Rails, React, Javascript and D3, and just moved to New York from Texas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from University of North Texas with a BA in psychology and a minor in computer science. From there I worked as a pension analyst at Willis Towers Watson, then moved on to work as a research assistant at Dr. Rodney Nielsen's fantastic Human Intelligence and Language Technologies lab at UNT. I was basically the psychologist on staff, annotating transcripts so we could use them for Natural Language Processing. That’s what interested me in development, and I decided that web development was what I could learn fastest and just jump right into. So I went to App Academy, graduated, and started building my own projects!
